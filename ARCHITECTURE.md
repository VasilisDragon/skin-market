# ARCHITECTURE.md — skin-market

## What this project is, in one sentence

A locally-hosted, eventually-public CS2 skin market data aggregation service with a Discord-native LLM frontend, designed to compete with Pricempire and CSFloat on Discord UX and AI-powered deal evaluation.

## Critical workflow rules

**Before debugging a symptom, state in one sentence what the app is supposed to do in that state. If you can't, that's the first thing to figure out.**

**You cannot see screenshots from the user's chat with the upstream Claude.** Prefer text-based diagnostics — console output, curl results, computed values, SQL query results — over screenshot references in prompts you write back. If you need to see something visual, write code to print it as text or save it to a file the user can describe to you.

**Architecture decisions get committed to ADR files.** When you make a non-obvious choice (library selection, schema shape, API design), drop a one-page `docs/adr/NNN-title.md` explaining what you picked, what you rejected, and why. Future-you will thank present-you.

**No "magic" libraries.** Prefer boring, well-documented tools the user can debug at 2am with a Stack Overflow search: `httpx`, `psycopg` (v3), `sqlalchemy`, `fastapi`, `apscheduler`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`. Skip exotic frameworks even if they look slicker.

**Tests for non-trivial logic.** Pure data-shuffling doesn't need tests. Pricing math, deal evaluation, schema migrations, anything that has a "right answer" — test it. `pytest` is the default.

**The user is a Systems Engineer at an MSP, not a Python expert.** Code should be readable by someone who knows infrastructure but not the latest Python idioms. Type hints, yes. Docstrings on public functions, yes. Clever metaclass tricks, no.

Layers and their responsibilities:

- **Collectors:** Pure data ingestion. Two families:
  - **Per-item collectors** (Steam, Skinport, DMarket) — one Python module per source, one HTTP call per item per cycle, written to `prices`. Each runs on its own APScheduler-driven schedule via the `BaseCollector` abstraction. Used for the curated 48-item watchlist.
  - **Bulk-snapshot collector** (Pricempire, Phase 2a) — one Python module that pulls the entire ~39,400-item CS2 catalog in one HTTP call and writes per-provider rows to a separate `pricempire_observations` hypertable. Does NOT extend `BaseCollector`; ADR 018/019 document why. Provides breadth coverage layered on top of the curated direct-poll collectors.
  Both families share no business logic; just fetch, normalize, write.
- **Database (Postgres + TimescaleDB extension):** Source of truth. Hypertables for time-series price data, regular tables for items and metadata.
- **Analytics jobs:** Cron-triggered Python that computes derived data — moving averages, volume anomalies, price velocity, news-correlated moves. Output to `insights` tables.
- **FastAPI app:** Read-only API. The bot doesn't touch Postgres directly; it goes through this layer. This is also the future SaaS API surface.
- **Hermes skill:** A skill bundle (SKILL.md + tool definitions) that gives the Discord bot capabilities like `query_current_price(item)`, `query_price_history(item, days)`, `render_chart(item, days)`, `evaluate_deal(item, float, price)`.

The LLM only enters the picture in two places:
1. The Hermes bot parses the user's Discord message and decides which skill tools to call (query path)
2. The analytics jobs occasionally use Ollama to generate market commentary from news + price data (enrichment path, async)

It does NOT do data fetching, scraping, parsing, or math. Those are deterministic Python.

## Anti-patterns to specifically avoid

- **Don't have the bot scrape live.** All data goes through the collector → DB → API path. If the bot tries to bypass and curl Steam directly, that's a bug.
- **Don't over-poll Steam.** They will block you. Maximum 50 items per polling cycle, 30-minute cycles, exponential backoff on 429s. Skinport is more permissive.
- **Don't use floats for money.** PostgreSQL `NUMERIC(12,2)` for all prices. Python `Decimal` for math.
- **Don't trust item name strings as primary keys.** Steam's `market_hash_name` is canonical-ish but has edge cases (StatTrak™ has a unicode TM, the spaces matter). Use a normalized slug + the raw name + a UUID PK.
- **Don't catch generic exceptions.** Catch specific ones (`httpx.TimeoutException`, `httpx.HTTPStatusError`). A bare `except:` swallowing bugs is the source of half of all production incidents.
- **Don't put secrets in code or commit them.** `.env` file, never committed. The Discord bot token, the CSFloat API key (later), the PostgreSQL password — all environment variables.

## Fatigue monitoring during long sessions

During multi-session relayed debugging, watch for these signals from the user:
- Repeating an already-answered question
- Sending data that doesn't match the ask
- Confusing which bug/session is active
- Losing track of whether a fix was tested vs just written
- Apologizing for "screwing up chains"

Two or more signals stacking — gently suggest a break. The user has explicitly requested this monitoring.

## When the user shares others' messages

Assess substance and register separately. Informal tone isn't evidence of shallow thinking. Identify what facts would distinguish charitable from uncharitable reads; if unavailable, reserve judgment and ask rather than defaulting to the rhetorically rewarding interpretation.

## Definition of done for each phase

A phase is done when:
1. All listed deliverables are present in the repo
2. Tests pass (`pytest`)
3. `docker compose up -d` brings the relevant services up cleanly
4. There's a short demo command or curl in `README.md` showing it works
5. An ADR is committed for any architectural decision that wasn't pre-specified

## Things explicitly out of scope for v1

- Float-tier pricing (CSFloat integration is v2)
- Multi-game support (v4)
- News/speculation layer (v3)
- Web frontend (v5)
- User accounts / auth (v5+)
- Payment integration (v5+)
- Real-time websocket pricing (v6+ if ever)
- **Passive message logging.** The bot does NOT log non-addressed Discord
  messages to any database. Discord's developer ToS restricts this, and the
  privacy story doesn't work for a future paid product. The bot stores only
  messages it was directly addressed in (via @-mention or slash command).
- **Autonomous prediction generation.** The bot does NOT generate market
  predictions on its own initiative based on chat content. Predictions,
  when they exist (post-v1), are explicitly user-triggered (e.g. a
  `/predict` command).
- **Self-scheduled prediction validation loops.** No cron jobs that grade
  past predictions against actual prices in v1. The infrastructure for
  this is post-v1.
- **LLM-generated markdown knowledge files.** The bot does NOT write
  summary `.md` files that it later reads as a poor-man's memory layer.
  Structured storage (Postgres tables) is the canonical knowledge source;
  drift between LLM-written summaries and underlying data is a known
  anti-pattern we're avoiding by construction.
- **Live external API calls from the bot's reply path.** The bot reads
  from the local Postgres only. If an item isn't in our DB, the correct
  response is "I don't track that item — request it be added to the
  watchlist." Never have the bot scrape Steam/Skinport during a Discord
  conversation.
